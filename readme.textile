bq. Young at heart 
 Fresh from the start 
 Step up into the next generation 

The International Formula Master (IFM) was the successor of the F3000 International Masters series. It was held as a supporting series during the European WTCC races from 2007 till 2009. The series was a junior Formula series which was thought as a stepping stone into the GP2 just like the Formula 3 Euro Series. The cars were manufactured by Italian based company Tatuus and were comparable to smaller single seaters like the Formula 3 cars. However they looked more like a small version of a pre-2009 Formula 1 car.

The premiere mod of CTDP for rFactor 2 brings you the complete 2009 season with all cars that competed over the full season.
