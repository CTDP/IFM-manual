 Fresh from the start
 Step up into the next generation

The International Formula Master (IFM) was the successor of the F3000 International Masters series. It was held as a supporting series during the European WTCC races from 2007 till 2009. The series was a junior Formula series which was thought as a stepping stone into the GP2 just like the Formula 3 Euro Series. The cars were manufactured by Italian based company Tatuus and were comparable to smaller single seaters like the Formula 3 cars. However they looked more like a small version of a pre-2009 Formula 1 car.
